Tackled two ways of finding Diameter of a Binary Tree
One having Brute force approach of going to every node and checking lh and rh side and sum them up and compare the sum with every node's lh+rh.
This approach can have two types of complexity one is O(N) if we use to recursive functions one of finding height and other of finding diameter.

The optimal and O(N) approach can be done by calculation height and diameter simultaneosly. This can be done by calculating height of every node and comparing the diameter that is 
lh+rh of every node at the same time. The worst TC can goes to O(N) even for skew case.
